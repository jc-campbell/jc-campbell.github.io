Welcome to my portfolio! I am an economics student with a passion for research in finance, banking, and economic modeling. My academic and professional interests revolve around understanding financial markets, risk assessment, and the intersection of economics with policy decisions.

Throughout my studies, I have worked extensively with data analysis, statistical modeling, and programming. I am proficient in Python, R and JavaScript, with experience in machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and economic forecasting. My work often involves optimizing complex problems, such as financial models and market predictions, using tools like PyMC, AMPL, and scikit-learn. [See my projects.](/projects)

Beyond my technical skills, I enjoy exploring interdisciplinary research, particularly how economic models can be enhanced using computational methods. Currently, I am seeking opportunities in finance, economic research, or data science where I can apply my skills in quantitative analysis, programming, and problem-solving. If you would like to connect, feel free to reach out!
